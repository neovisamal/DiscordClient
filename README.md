# DiscordClient

This is a completely botched/hacked up of TanujKS's DiscordClient (https://github.com/TanujKS/DiscordClient). This version is designed to stay relatively silent and rather than log only edits/deletes, it logs all messages (posted, edited, deleted) and sends them to Scalyr via the Scalyr API. Lots of work left:
- Reacts
- Query scalyr from discrod and have results posted in graph form.
